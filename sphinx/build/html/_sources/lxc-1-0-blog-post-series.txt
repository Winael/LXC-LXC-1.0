Intro.  Blog post series
************************

So it’s almost the end of the year, I’ve got about 10 days of vacation for the holidays and a bit of time on my hands.

Since I’ve been doing quite a bit of work on LXC lately in prevision for the LXC_ 1.0 release early next year, I thought that it’d be a good use of some of that extra time to blog about the current state of LXC.

.. _LXC: http://linuxcontainers.org/

As a result, I’m preparing a series of 10 blog posts covering what I think are some of the most exciting features of LXC. The planned structure is:

- :ref:`lxc-1-0-your-first-ubuntu-container`
- :ref:`lxc-1-0-your-second-container`
- :ref:`lxc-1-0-advanced-container-usage`
- :ref:`lxc-1-0-some-more-advanced-container-usage`
- :ref:`lxc-1-0-container-storage`
- :ref:`lxc-1-0-security-features`
- :ref:`lxc-1-0-unprivileged-containers`
- :ref:`lxc-1-0-scripting-with-the-api`
- LXC 1.0: GUI in containers [9/10]
- LXC 1.0: Troubleshooting and debugging [10/10]

While they are all titled LXC 1.0, most of the things I’ll be showing will work just as well on older LXC. However some of the features will need a very very recent version of LXC (as in, current upstream git). I’ll try to make that clear and will explain how to use our `stable backports in Ubuntu <https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lxc>`_ or `current upstream snapshots from our PPA <https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-lxc/+archive/daily>`_.

I’ll be updating this first blog post with links to all of the posts in the series. So if you want to bookmark or refer to these, please use this post.
