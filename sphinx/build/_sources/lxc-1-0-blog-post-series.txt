So it’s almost the end of the year, I’ve got about 10 days of vacation for the holidays and a bit of time on my hands.

Since I’ve been doing quite a bit of work on LXC lately in prevision for the LXC_ 1.0 release early next year, I thought that it’d be a good use of some of that extra time to blog about the current state of LXC.

As a result, I’m preparing a series of 10 blog posts covering what I think are some of the most exciting features of LXC. The planned structure is:

- `1. Your first Ubuntu container`_
- `2. Your second container`_
- `3. Advanced container usage`_
- `4. Some more advanced container usage`_
- `5. Container storage`_
- `6. Security features`_
- LXC 1.0: Unprivileged containers [7/10]
- LXC 1.0: Scripting with the API [8/10]
- LXC 1.0: GUI in containers [9/10]
- LXC 1.0: Troubleshooting and debugging [10/10]

While they are all titled LXC 1.0, most of the things I’ll be showing will work just as well on older LXC. However some of the features will need a very very recent version of LXC (as in, current upstream git). I’ll try to make that clear and will explain how to use our `stable backports in Ubuntu`_ or `current upstream snapshots from our PPA`_.

I’ll be updating this first blog post with links to all of the posts in the series. So if you want to bookmark or refer to these, please use this post.
