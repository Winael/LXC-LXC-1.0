 LXC 1.0: Blog post series [0/10]
----------------------------------

So it’s almost the end of the year, I’ve got about 10 days of vacation for the holidays and a bit of time on my hands.

Since I’ve been doing quite a bit of work on LXC lately in prevision for the LXC_ 1.0 release early next year, I thought that it’d be a good use of some of that extra time to blog about the current state of LXC.

As a result, I’m preparing a series of 10 blog posts covering what I think are some of the most exciting features of LXC. The planned structure is:

`LXC 1.0: Your first Ubuntu container [1/10]`_
`LXC 1.0: Your second container [2/10]`_
`LXC 1.0: Advanced container usage [3/10]`_
`LXC 1.0: Some more advanced container usage [4/10]`_
LXC 1.0: Container storage [5/10]
LXC 1.0: Security features [6/10]
LXC 1.0: Unprivileged containers [7/10]
LXC 1.0: Scripting with the API [8/10]
LXC 1.0: GUI in containers [9/10]
LXC 1.0: Troubleshooting and debugging [10/10]

While they are all titled LXC 1.0, most of the things I’ll be showing will work just as well on older LXC. However some of the features will need a very very recent version of LXC (as in, current upstream git). I’ll try to make that clear and will explain how to use our `stable backports in Ubuntu`_ or `current upstream snapshots from our PPA`_.

I’ll be updating this first blog post with links to all of the posts in the series. So if you want to bookmark or refer to these, please use this post.
